  <section id="about">
    <h2>About GioGPT</h2>
    <p>Welcome to GioGPT! This website was designed by Jack Giordano, a passionate student at Virginia Tech, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. As someone who enjoys tackling complex problems and creating efficient solutions, I designed this chatbot to reflect that philosophy—short, to the point, and effective.</p>
    
    <p>The idea behind GioGPT is simple: to offer concise, intelligent responses that help users quickly find the information they need. Whether you're here for quick answers or just casual conversations, GioGPT is designed to make your experience fast and streamlined.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Currently, I'm in the final stages of my academic journey and actively seeking a full-time role as a software engineer. Looking ahead, there are exciting plans to expand this project even further. In the coming months, I'm working on developing a dedicated GioGPT app for iOS, so stay tuned for more updates!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope GioGPT helps you just as much as it has helped me.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>— Jack Giordano</p>
